Overview

YogaFlow is a minimalistic web-based yoga app designed to guide users through various yoga routines. By integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a Flask application, it provides a serene and distraction-free yoga experience. A resonating gong marks the transition between poses every minute, facilitating a smooth flow through the session.
Features

    Users can choose from a variety of preset yoga routines. 
    Alternatively users can create their own routines or use the assistance of AI to create custom routines..
    Pose Transitions: A calming gong sound signals every minute to indicate the next pose.

Current Progress
